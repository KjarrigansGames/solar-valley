# Solar Valley Ideas

## Gameplay Changes

* People = Clustered Workforce, all connected houses and fields are calculated together for demand and supply
* Food - show as new resource in the HUD (a production rate value) - negative=less gold, positive=income
* Energy - show as new resource in the HUD (a production rate value) - negative=less gold, positive=income
* Probably remove the Day-Counter (or rename it, you can't build a city with that story-line in a day)
* Add "story" popup messages, triggered on various events (mostly people milestone reached)
* Add tooltip for build-menu
* Rework tooltip for existing buildings (mainly to reflect the Gameplay changes)

## Core-Loop-Changes

* In the OG houses and fields had to be adjacent and one field would equally divide it's yield to all neighbouring houses 
  BUT a house with 2 Level 1 fields and 1 Watered Field would still only receive 21 Food (altough the Math said 28)
* Due to that, the "ideal" building pattern looked relatively boring/repetetive, so I want to make clusters instead
* A cluster is a group of tiles of the same type producing and using up resources. They still have to be adjacent so you have to "expand"
  your existing settlement and hopefully get something more organically looking
* All buildings will be slightly reworked and all have a "unique" behaviour as proof-of-concept/base-template for possible "new" buildings:
   * house -> upgradable multiple times
   * field -> upgradable with path/choice
   * well  -> AoE effect
   * solar -> Only produces resources during certain hours
   * (graveyard -> global one-time placement effect/bonus)

## Buildings

* Houses - Modify a bit to get multiple "levels"
   * Level 1 - Cottage (Up to 5 people)
   * Level 2 - Farm house (Up to 10 people)
   * Level 3 - Mansion (Up to 15 people)
   * Level 4 - Residential Unit (Up to 25 people)
* Fields - Use the 3 existing tiles to make an upgrade choice
   * Level 1 - Garden plot
   * Level 2a - Farmland (Improved Yield)
   * Level 2b - Greenhouse (More money)
* Well - Show AoE
* Solar Panel - Show AoE
* Graveyard - remove it

## Add a Basic Story-Line

Your SO and a befriended couple are tired of the big city life and the climate change debate. You want to DO something instead of just talking about it. So you bought a house with a patch of land in the middle of nowhere trying to become self-sufficient.

### Stage 1 - Micromanagement - Zoomed in as close as possible

At the moment you buy electricity from the public power grid and food from the store. Start working the land to grow your own food! You start with 4 people

Events:
* self-sufficient. You produce more food than you can eat, what about selling the excess at the local farmers market and The befriended couple wants it's own house because they expect twins (6 people)
* you expect a child as well (7 people)
* your brother, his partner and his child want to join, build another house (10 people)
* self-sufficient again. A Reporter wants to write a newspaper article about your community -  Name your community!

### Stage 2 - Grow the settlement - Unlock Zoom Level 1

The local newspaper prints an article about your growing community and now the phone rings ceaselessly. More people want to join. You need to add more fields and more houses!

Events:
* We're now 30 people and you can't manage nor decide all the things alone anymore. A council is elected with you as the mayor.
* 35 people. The council hired an old farmer. He teaches you how to dig a well and increase your yield.
* 50 people. Growing food is nice but you still need money for all the things you can't make yourself. A member proposes special fields for high quality food to sell
* 75 people. Space is precious. Build/Upgrade to farm houses
* 100 people. The council wants to go a step further and also produce electricity themselves. They were able to make a contract with a local solar panel supplier.
* 150 people. An architect wants to support your noble cause by providing a bluebrint for bigger, solarpowered houses.
* 250 people. A university learned about your thriving community and provides an even better house design

### Stage 3 - City Building (Endless mode) - Unlock Zoom Level 2

Congratulations. You finished the story-line. Feel free to expand your growing village to gain as much self-sufficient families as possible.

## Random Ideas

* (re)add the graveyard as additional building, not sure what it shall do
* utilize the day/night-cycle - only sell food during the day, no solar energy during the night
* Allow to destroy a building  / an Undo Button to fix missclicks
* Share-Score-Badge/Screenshot
